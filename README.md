>## Purpose:
>>#### What will the application do?
>- The application is designed to assist merchants in efficiently 
and accurately managing their stores by providing a means to 
record and store the quantities and prices of both incoming and
outgoing goods. This application will prove to be immensely 
beneficial for merchants as it will enable them to have better
control and oversight of their inventory.
>>#### Who will use it?
>- For _**merchants**_ who sell large quantities of products.
>- For those _**manufacturers**_ who produce large quantities of products.
>- For _**managers**_ who manage large warehouses.
>>#### Why is this project of interest to you?
>- My parents own a store that specializes in plastic pipes and fittings
and have an extensive range of products, as I have observed. They have 
often expressed frustration due to their inability to accurately track 
the remaining quantities of specific goods in stock. In order to address
this issue, I have developed an inventory management software specifically 
tailored to their needs and requirements. This software aims to help them 
better manage their inventory and improve their overall store operations.
>- After completing my studies in Data Science100, I have come to realize
the immense value and potential of data. In the context of selling goods, 
by recording the quantities and types of goods sold, we can utilize 
data analysis to make informed predictions about future sales. This 
information can then be used to optimize the purchase quantities of 
goods when making restocking decisions, which can greatly improve the 
efficiency and profitability of our sales operations.

>## User Stories:
> - As a user, I want to be able to add a specified quantity of a product to my warehouse inventory.
> - As a user, I want to be able to view a list of products and their respective quantities in my warehouse.
> - As a user, I want to be able to remove a specified quantity of a product from my warehouse for selling or due to damage.
> - As a user, I want to be able to view a list of product removal records, including the product name and quantity.
> - As a user, I want to be able to view my company's information in my user profile.
> - As a user, I want to be able to view the percentage of each item in stock in my basic inventory information.
> - As a user, I want to be able to save my list of items in the warehouse.
> - As a user, I want to be able to save my list of items adding or removing records in the warehouse.
> - As a user, I want to be able to load my list of items in the warehouse.
> - As a user, I want to be able to load my list of items adding or removing records in the warehouse.

>## Instructions for Grader:
>>#### Username: Daniel
>>#### Password: 123
> - You can try using the wrong username or password to see the reminding sentence at the bottom.
> - You can generate the first required action related to adding Xs to a Y by click the second button on the option panel
, click add item button, input the name, quantity, location of the item, and click submit button. You will see the items
bar chart, storage records, items list changes.
> - You can generate the second required action related to adding Xs to a Y by click the second button on the option panel
, click remove item button, input the name, quantity, location of the item, and click submit button.You will see the items 
bar chart, storage records, items list changes.
> - You can type the item that you want near the add and remove button, click the search image button, and you will see
the items list panel below showing the item you want, but if there is no that name of item in the warehouse, there is a pop-up
window. Notably, you can click search button with no text input to the textField to go back to see all the items!
> - You can locate my visual component by click the first button on the option panel, and you will see the bar chart of 
the items in the warehouse. 
> - You can save the state of my application by click close the frame button on the top left side of the frame, you 
will see the pop-up window, and click yes to save the data.
> - You can reload the state of my application by click login from the login frame(Username: Daniel, Password: 123), 
you will see the pop-up window, and click yes to reload data from database.

>## Phase 4: Task 2:
>>#### Thu Apr 06 17:22:38 PDT 2023
>>#### 50 apple added to warehouse
>
>>#### Thu Apr 06 17:22:48 PDT 2023
>>#### 50 grape added to warehouse
>
>>#### Thu Apr 06 17:22:57 PDT 2023
>>#### 50 grape removed from warehouse
>
>>#### Thu Apr 06 17:23:08 PDT 2023
>>#### 100 pear removed from warehouse

>## Phase 4: Task 3:
> As evident from my UML diagram, I did not utilize abstract classes and interfaces effectively to structure my code.
> Instead, I primarily relied on simple associations, which adversely impacted the readability, reusability, 
> and maintainability of my code.
> 
> To improve the code structure, if I had more time, I would create an abstract class for Login and 
> WarehouseManagementSystem respectively. These two systems share many methods between their corresponding GUIs,
> and using abstract classes would help reduce code duplication and make future modifications to the methods easier 
> to handle.
> 
> By implementing these changes, I could significantly enhance the quality of my code and ensure that 
> it is more readable, reusable, and maintainable.
